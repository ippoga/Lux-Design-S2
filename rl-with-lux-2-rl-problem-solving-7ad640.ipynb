Make sure to read them to learn how to the game works, and the rest of this tutorial will be much easier to understand.\n\nPart 1 of the series covered the single-agent RL setup, but Lux AI Season 2 is multi-agent! Moreover, the environment has different phases and a complex action space which makes it difficult to learn or use of the box. \n\nThis tutorial will cover simple tools and tricks on how to reduce a complex problem into a easier one! We will primarily focus on three things: \n\n1. Simplifying the action space with controllers/action wrappers\n2. Simplifying observations\n3. Transforming the three phase Lux AI game into a single phase game\n\nThis starter kit is also implemented in https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-S2/tree/main/kits/rl/sb3\n\nWe highly **recommend running this code on a GPU** as RL training can be fairly slow and needs good tuning.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1. Simplifying the Action Space\n\nThe action space is quite complicated in Lux S2 as each robot can move, dig, transfer/pickup, all in addition to being able to combine any sequence of these primitives into an action queue of up to length 20. For machine learning, such a massive action space leads to the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), making any ML algorithm have a much harder time to learn something useful, especially in RL.\n\nTo handle this, we can program a custom Controller that translates actions from one action space to the original action space and adds a few tricks and heuristics to be integrated with RL training. Since the original lux action space is large, this controller can be a little complicated. For those who want to dive straight into training you can use the controller as is. \n\nFor a high-level overview this controller will\n- Define a massively simplified action space\n- Translate actions from the discrete action space into the Lux S2 action space `action_to_lux_action`\n- Add a heuristic factory action to build one Heavy robot\n- Generate action masks where False = an action is invalid\n\nOverall, the action space of the controller is a discrete action space with just 12 dimensions to control just one heavy robot. It allows for a robot's 4 directional movement, transferring ice in 4 directions in addition to center, picking up power, digging, and a no-op action. This doesn't include factory actions, self destruct, recharging, transferring other types of resources, or longer planned action queues in the action space, which are all open problems for you to potentially tackle!\n\nThe controller also includes a trick to allow agents to reduce power costs incurred by action queue updates. The controller skips updating action queues if the existing action queue is the same as the new one the agent wants to use for the robot.\n\nWhile this simplification doesn't include adding in more complex things like more heavy robots or planting lichen, it will train out a succesful policy that with simple modifications, will beat the majority of bots using the rule-based starter kits.\n\nMore advanced usages can consider how to model the actions of different types of units on a game board (e.g. heavy, light, or factory) by using a MultiDiscrete action space. A more practical and likely winning solution can be to use a image-like controller by generating actions for each tile on the board and only using the actions with friendly units on that tile.

Simplifying the Observation Space\n\nLux S2 is fully observable which means you can see everything on the map, the opponents units etc. However, this is very high dimensional and not necessarily easy to learn from due to the curse of dimensionality (again!). We want to simplify this observation space in a way that contains sufficient information to learn a good policy but is also easy to learn from.\n\nFor this tutorial, we will create a state-based observation space (no image like features e.g. the rubble, ice, ore maps) with some feature engineering that includes useful information such as the distance to the closest factory and ice tile. The wrapper we provide below will use the `gym.ObservationWrapper` interface. Note that since we are focusing on just controlling one heavy robot, the observation wrapper is written to only support one heavy robot (and returns 0 if there are none).\n\n\nMore advanced solutions can look into using the full set of observations and designing the appropriate neural net architecture to process them.

Transforming Lux S2 into a Single Phase\n\nNormally RL frameworks like Stable Baselines 3, RLlib, Tianshou etc. expect the action space and observation space to be consistent throughout an episode. Lux S2 does not conform to this as we add some additional complexity like bidding and factory placement phases. A simple way to get around this is to **upgrade the reset function.**\n\nPreviously we saw that `env.reset()` resets an environment to a clean slate. We will upgrade this function by building a environment wrapper that not only resets to the clean slate, but also handles the bidding and factory placement phases so effectively agents that are learning start from game states with factories already placed.\n\nBelow will build a wrapper that works with the SB3 package. To do this, we want to provide the wrapper a bidding policy and factory placement policy which will be used by all teams to handle the first two phases in the reset function. The code below does just that by overriding the environment's reset function in the wrapper. \n\nFurthermore, we want to use the Controller we defined earlier, so that is also an argument to the SB3Wrapper and we use it to transform actions inside the `env.step` function","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from typing import Callable, Dict\n\nimport gym\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.typing as npt\nfrom gym import spaces\n\nimport luxai_s2.env\nfrom luxai_s2.env import LuxAI_S2\nfrom luxai_s2.state import ObservationStateDict\nfrom luxai_s2.unit import ActionType, BidActionType, FactoryPlacementActionType\nfrom luxai_s2.utils import my_turn_to_place_factory\nfrom luxai_s2.wrappers.controllers import (\n    Controller,\n)\n\n\nclass SB3Wrapper(gym.Wrapper):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        env: LuxAI_S2,\n        bid_policy: Callable[\n            [str, ObservationStateDict], Dict[str, BidActionType]\n        ] = None,\n        factory_placement_policy: Callable[\n            [str, ObservationStateDict], Dict[str, FactoryPlacementActionType]\n        ] = None,\n        controller: Controller = None,\n    ) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        A environment wrapper for Stable Baselines 3.

Training with RL\n\nIn the previous tutorial, we saw how to train an agent with SB3 in single-agent environments. Handling true multi-agent via training separate or shared policies to control all agents requires a few extra things so instead, for the purpose of a tutorial we will treat Lux S2 like a single agent environment by training a policy for one team and letting the other team simply do nothing.\n\nMoreover, we want to define our own reward function to encourage our robots to seek ice, dig it, and return to a factory so it can generate water and survive longer. To do this all, we will just create a custom environment wrapper.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import copy\nclass CustomEnvWrapper(gym.Wrapper):\n    def __init__(self, env: gym.Env) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Adds a custom reward and turns the LuxAI_S2 environment into a single-agent environment for easy training\n        \"\"\"\n        super().__init__(env)\n        self.prev_step_metrics = None\n\n    def step(self, action):\n        agent = \"player_0\"\n        opp_agent = \"player_1\"\n        \n        friend_factories = self.env.state.factories[agent]\n        for k in friend_factories.keys():\n            factory = friend_factories[k]\n             # set enemy factories to have 1000 water to keep them alive the whole around and treat the game as single-agent\n            factory.cargo.water = 1000\n\n        opp_factories = self.env.state.factories[opp_agent]\n        for k in opp_factories.keys():\n            factory = opp_factories[k]\n             # set enemy factories to have 1000 water to keep them alive the whole around and treat the game as single-agent\n            factory.cargo.water = 1000\n\n        # submit actions for just one agent to make it single-agent\n        # and save single-agent versions of the data below\n        action = {agent: action}\n        obs, _, done, info = self.env.step(action)\n        obs = obs[agent]\n        done = done[agent]\n        \n        # we collect stats on teams here.

Since kaggle servers don't have Stable Baselines 3 installed, `nn.py` is where we program some utility functions as well as the neural network model to load the SB3 trained weights into a PyTorch neural network model. `agent.py` will then use those utilities to load the model zip file at `MODEL_WEIGHTS_RELATIVE_PATH` which can be changed at the top of `agent.py`\n\n`agent.py` also uses the actions_mask function to invalidate some actions so that the policy only generates valid actions, which is a easy way to improve performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# if running on kaggle, run below to copy the rl starter kit files to the working directory\n!cp -r ../input/luxai-s2-rl-sb3-kit/* .\n!mv best_model.dontunzipme best_model.zip # kaggle auto unzips files but we don't want it to here so we do this","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-15T14:10:48.243303Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-15T14:10:48.243873Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-15T14:10:48.243574Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-15T14:10:48.243600Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# if you trained an actual agent, copy its model weights here\n!mv logs/exp_1/models/best_model.zip best_model.zip","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-02-15T14:10:48.251814Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-02-15T14:10:48.252392Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-02-15T14:10:48.252077Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-02-15T14:10:48.252105Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nTo submit your trained agent create a .tar.gz file.

A simple improvement would be to add lichen planting to the action space / controller or program it directly as a rule in the agent.py file, allowing you to score points by the end of the game as well as generate more power.\n\nAnother easy idea is to modify the `agent.py` code so that you spawn multiple factories and multiple heavy robots, and simply run the trained policy on each heavy robot.\n\n\nIf you want to look into more scalable solutions, it's critical to first figure out how to model multiple units at once. This kit shows you how to control a single heavy robot effectively but not multiple. Another thing to consider is what observations and features would be the most useful. Finally, you can always try and develop a more complex action controller in addition to developing better reward functions.\n\nIf you feel you are experienced enough, you can take a look at [last season's winning solution by team Toad Brigade](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2021/discussion/294993) or [our paper: Emergent collective intelligence from massive-agent cooperation and competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01609) which show how to use convolutional neural nets and various other techniques (e.g. invalid action masking) to control a massive number of units at once.","metadata":{}}]}
